NOTES: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each sub question is self-contained, which means, for example, assumptions
 from part (b) does not carry to part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few of these questions are directly taken (or modified slightly) from
 Varian's and Lima's books, as well as Sarah Komisarow's and Grace Tsiang's
 problem sets from previous school year.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider the following expenditure minimization problem [EMP]:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\min_{x,y} &  & p_{x}x+p_{y}y\\
s.t. &  & x^{\alpha}y^{1-\alpha}=\bar{U}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 denote the Lagrange multiplier on the utility constraint.

\begin_layout Enumerate
By now, we solved the following utility maximization problem [UMP] (see
 pset 2, part 2, problem 3): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\max_{x,y} &  & x^{\alpha}y^{1-\alpha}\\
s.t. &  & p_{x}x+p_{y}y=m
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{\star}$
\end_inset

, Marshallian demand functions 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{m}(p_{x},p_{y},m)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{m}(p_{x},p_{y},m)$
\end_inset

, and the indirect utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $v(p_{x},p_{y},m)$
\end_inset

.
 Problem 1 solved the corresponding EMP to obtain the Lagrange multiplier

 is going on.
