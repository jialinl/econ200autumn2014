\begin_layout Standard
Each sub question is self-contained, which means, for example, assumptions
 from part (b) does not carry to part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few of these questions are directly taken (or modified slightly) from
 Varian's and Lima's books, as well as Sarah Komisarow's and Grace Tsiang's
 problem sets from previous school year.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider the Cobb-Douglas utility function:
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$

 Which of the three people would you expect to buy the most

Consider, now, the logarithmic transformation of Cobb-Douglas preferences:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U(x,y) & = & \alpha\log(x)+(1-\alpha)\log(y)

 Compare it with the marginal rate of substitution in part (e) of question

 What do you conclude? Is logarithmic transformation a monotonic transformation?

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Construct three indifference curves, for 
\begin_inset Formula $U=1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $U=2$

\begin_inset Formula $U=3$

Now, let the relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 Draw this in your coordinate plane.
 Find the point of intersection between the line and each indifference curve.
 Computer the MRS at each of these three points.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Prove that decreasing marginal rates of substitution are consistent with
 both increasing and diminishing marginal utilities.
 You can do this either by providing specific examples of utility functions,
 or using mathematical arguments.
 
\emph on
Hint: it should be easy to come up with utility functions with diminishing
 marginal utilities, try negating the function see if it is increasing in
 marginal utilities.
 Then compare the MRS.

\emph default
 The important message in this problem is this: decreasing marginal rates
 of substitution and diminishing marginal utility are 
\series bold
\emph on
distinct

 concepts; there is no link between the properties of marginal utility and
 the properties of the MRS precisely because a utility function is just
 a convenient form of representing a preference relation and the family
 of indifference curves obtained from them.
 The key conditions needed to determine an individual's behavior pertain
 to his indifference curves.
 A decreasing MRS, 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 diminishing marginal utility, is the condition that we need to be able
 to study individual behavior.
 It is the indifference curves that matter for individual behavior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use this utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $U(x,y)=(x^{-\sigma}+y^{-\sigma)})^{-\frac{1}{\sigma}}$
\end_inset

.
 Calculate and explain in words the interpretation of these three concepts,
 and the relationship between them: the marginal rates of substitution,
 the marginal utility, and the elasticity of substitution.
 Be sure to talk about what properties of the indifference curve they each
 capture (hint: level, shape, slope, etc).
 What about them that have to be true for any utility function to represent
 a well-behaved preference (i.e.
 completeness, transitivity, reflexivity, monotonicity, and convexity assumption
s all fulfilled)? Hint: revisit question 3.

Mary's indifference curve crosses three consumption bundles: point A (80
 apple, 2 pizza), point B (40 apples, 3 pizza), and point C (20 apples,
 4 pizza).
 Her indifference curve is convex and smooth.
 Mary is willing to exchange 50 apples for a marginal amount of extra consumptio
