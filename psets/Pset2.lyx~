Prove that decreasing marginal rates of substitution are consistent with
 both increasing and diminishing marginal utilities.
 You can do this either by providing specific examples of utility functions,
 or using mathematical arguments.
 
\emph on
Hint: it should be easy to come up with utility functions with diminishing
 marginal utilities, try negating the function see if it is increasing in
 marginal utilities.
 Then compare the MRS.

\emph default
 The important message in this problem is this: decreasing marginal rates
 of substitution and diminishing marginal utility are 
\series bold
\emph on
distinct
\series default
\emph default
 concepts; there is no link between the properties of marginal utility and
 the properties of the MRS precisely because a utility function is just
 a convenient form of representing a preference relation and the family
 of indifference curves obtained from them.
 The key conditions needed to determine an individual's behavior pertain
 to his indifference curves.
 A decreasing MRS, 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 diminishing marginal utility, is the condition that we need to be able
 to study individual behavior.
 It is the indifference curves that matter for individual behavior.

Use this utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $U(x,y)=(x^{-\sigma}+y^{-\sigma)})^{-\frac{1}{\sigma}}$
\end_inset

.
 Calculate and explain in words the interpretation of these three concepts,
 and the relationship between them: the marginal rates of substitution,
 the marginal utility, and the elasticity of substitution.
 Be sure to talk about what properties of the indifference curve they each
 capture (hint: level, shape, slope, etc).
 What about them has to be true for any utility function to represent a
 well-behaved preference (i.e.
 completeness, transitivity, reflexivity, monotonicity, and convexity assumption
s all fulfilled)? Hint: revisit question 3.
