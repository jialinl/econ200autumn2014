NOTES: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each sub question is self-contained, which means, for example, assumptions
 from part (b) does not carry to part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you graph the budget lines, it is REQUIRED that you provide the value
 or mathematical expression of the slope and the intersections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few of these questions are directly taken (or modified slightly) from
 Varian's and Lima's books, as well as Sarah Komisarow's and Grace Tsiang's
 problem sets from previous school year.

\begin_layout Part
Budget Sets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose initially the United States faces a budget line of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{x}x+p_{y}y=m$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{x}$
\end_inset

 is the unit labor cost, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{y}$
\end_inset

 is the unit capital cost, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is nation's total wealth.
 Because international competition from abroad, the unit labor cost reduces
 to half its original price and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{y}$
\end_inset

 reduces even more to only a third of the original price.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 does not change.

\begin_deeper

 or loss of available consumption bundles due to international competition.
 (1 point)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 changes as well.
 How much would 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 have to change such that the maximum consumption of labor input is back
 to the initial value? Is the United States better or worse off now compared
 with the initial case? (2 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Find data on average hourly REAL wage (think of it as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{x}$
\end_inset

) for manufacturing production worker in the United States in 2000 and 2010
 (so 2 data points) from google or whatever site you believe in.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 have not changed.
 Is the budget set larger or smaller in 2000 compared with a decade later?

\begin_layout Enumerate
Anne is a frequent flier whose fares are reduced 25% after she flies 25,000
 miles a year and then by 50% after she flies 50,000 miles.
 Assume that the price of 1 mile is $10, the price of a unit of all other
 goods is $1, and she has wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 which is large enough to purchase more than 50,000 miles worth of airfare.

Nathan has $100 on his debit card (he only has this one card for all his
 consumption, no other means of money) to spend on pizza and coffee.
 The first three cups of coffee cost $3 dollar each.
 The rest cost $1 dollar (think of it as cheap refills).
 $20 for the first pizza, half of off for the second and third, $5 for the
 rest.

Suppose that a budget equation is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2}=m$

 The government decides to impose a lump-sum tax of 
\begin_inset Formula $u$

Mary's indifference curve crosses three consumption bundles: point A (80
 apples, 2 pizza), point B (40 apples, 3 pizza), and point C (20 apples,
 4 pizza).
 Her indifference curve is convex and smooth.
 Apples are on the x-axis and pizza is on the y-axis.
 Mary is willing to exchange 50 apples for a marginal amount of extra consumptio
n of pizza at point A, 30 at point B, and 10 at point C.

 Will Mary accept the offer? What about the same offer at point A and C?

\begin_layout Enumerate
What is the slope between point A and B if they were connected with a straight

 is greater than the slope between the two points? (3 points)
