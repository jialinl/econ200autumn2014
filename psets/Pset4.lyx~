\begin_layout Standard
Each sub question is self-contained, which means, for example, assumptions
 from part (b) does not carry to part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few of these questions are directly taken (or modified slightly) from
 Varian's and Lima's books, as well as Sarah Komisarow's and Grace Tsiang's
 problem sets from previous school year.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose a consumer has preferences between two goods that are perfect substitute
s.
 Can you change prices in such a way that the entire demand response is
 due to the income effect?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose that the preferences are concave.
 Is it still the case that the substitution effect is negative?

 following statements.
 Be brief (5 lines or less) and be very clear.

Consider a consumer that orders his preferences according to the following
 utility function defined over packs of cigarettes and bottles of beer:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}

 cigarettes equals 10 dollars per pack.

 beer with sufficient money so that he can still barely afford the consumption
 bundle he purchased before the price of beer bottles decreased.
