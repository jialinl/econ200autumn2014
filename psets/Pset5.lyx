NOTES: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each sub question is self-contained, which means, for example, assumptions
 from part (b) does not carry to part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few of these questions are directly taken (or modified slightly) from
 Varian's and Lima's books, as well as Sarah Komisarow's and Grace Tsiang's
 problem sets from previous school year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a total of 37 points possible.

Endowment Economy

\begin_layout Enumerate
Can you draw indifference curves and budget sets, such that at the low price
 of good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the consumer buys good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, but after the increase in the price of good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 he switches to selling, but is worse off as a result of the price increase?
 If so, draw it.
 If not, explain why not.
 (2 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
True, False, or Uncertain.
 Assume a consumer's choice set consists of two normal goods.
 If the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 good increases, will the consumer reduce consumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and is he necessarily worse off.
 [No points awarded without an explanation.] (4 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A poor rice farmer in India grows rice, a part of which he sells on the
 open market and the rest he and his family consume.
 If the price of rice in the open market increases, will this family increase
 or decrease its consumption of rice? Explain.
 (2 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The prices are 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{1},p_{2})=(2,3)$
\end_inset

, and the consumer is currently consuming 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{1},x_{2})=(4,4)$
\end_inset

.
 There is a perfect market for the two goods in which they can be brought
 and sold costlessly.
 Will the consumer prefer consuming the bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $(y_{1},y_{2})=(3,5)$
\end_inset

? (2 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The prices are 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{1},p_{2})=(2,3)$
\end_inset

, and the consumer is currently consuming 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{1},x_{2})=(4,4)$
\end_inset

.
 Now prices change to 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1},q_{2})=(2,4)$
\end_inset

.
 Could the consumer be better off under these new prices? (2 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Jessica is a farmer.
 She grows tomatoes and squash, which she also consumes.
 Suppose Jessica's utility function is given by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U(T,S) & = & T^{0.4}S^{0.6}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 denotes tomatoes and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 denotes squash.
 Assume that any quantity of tomatoes and any quantity of squash can be
 purchased.
 (10 points)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose that the price of tomatoes is 1 dollar and the price of squash is
 2 dollars.
 Jessica's farm produces 100 pounds of tomatoes and 50 pounds of squash.
 On a graph, draw the budget constraint in label the initial endowment point
 E.
 (1 point)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What are Jessica's gross demands? What are her net demands? Label her chosen
 (consumption) point 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
 (2 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose that before Jessica sells her endowment, the price of squash falls
 to 1 dollar and the price of tomatoes stays at 1 dollar.
 Draw and label the new budget constraint.
 Does Jessica's demand for squash rise or fall? By how much? What happens
 to demand for tomatoes? (3 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Plot (no need to calculate) the Hicksian substitution effect, the ordinary
 income effect, and the endowment effect on your diagram labeling each chosen
 point clearly.
 (1 point)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose that the price of squash falls after Jessica has sold her endowment
 for money.
 How much squash will she consume now? How about tomatoes? (2 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does the timing of the price change matter? Is Jessica better or worse off
 if the price change occurs before she sells her endowment, or after she
 sells her endowment? (1 point)

Labor Supply

\begin_layout Enumerate
If leisure is an inferior good, what can you say about the slope of the
 labor supply curve? (1 point)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider a consumer whose preferences are given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U(C,R) & = & \alpha\log C+(1-\alpha)\log R
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 denotes consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 denotes leisure.
 The consumer has 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 units of time that he can either allocate to leisure, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, or to labor, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 denote the nominal price of one unit of consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 denote the nominal wage.
 [hint: the solution will be at an interior point because with the Cobb-Douglass
 functional form, utility is zero if either consumption or leisure are zero.
 As a result, you do not need to use the Kuhn-Tucker conditions.] (12 points)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 denotes the consumer non-labor income, write out his full-income budget
 constraint.
 (1 point)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Derive the consumer's labor supply function.
 (3 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For what value of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 will the consumer supply positive hours of labor? (2 points)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose, that the consumer's labor income is taxed at the constant rate
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the consumerâ€™s nominal after-tax wage is 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\tau)w$
\end_inset

.
 Repeat problems (a)-(c).
 In addition, calculate how much revenue does the government collect from
 the tax? Also find out what value of tax rate maximizes the government's
 revenue.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Retail clothing stores often give salespersons discounts on clothes they
 purchase.
 This is done, presumably, to encourage salespersons to dress well.
 Demonstrate that this policy is less costly than raising salaries to achieve
 the same result.
 [Hint: income and substitution effect on labor supply.] (2 points)
